# Fly_Sky
The program "Fly Sky" is based on an air ticket management system. This is an offline software in which the administrator, customer, and sales representative all meet at the same time to achieve the software's purpose. This program is a platform where a consumer searches for an airline ticket, and the administrator and sales person ensure that the customer receives the intended outcome.
